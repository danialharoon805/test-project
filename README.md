In this app i maintain a uniqueId for every annonymous user who come to site so he can like and view posts but he can do it only once a day each post.

I have a state isLogin that i also store in local storage when a user sign up and login than ths state become true and give user permission to create a post.

That user can also Like and View once each post a day

I am calling Rest Apis for all these functionalities.

If user click a post a view would be added

If user click on like a view and like both will be added if not added before
